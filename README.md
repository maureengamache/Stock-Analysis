# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project
Client Steve wants to do more research for his parents related to the best stock in which to invest. He was pleased with the analysis done on the provided dataset, however now he wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. Given this new task, we will need to refactor our code to be able to run the the stock analysis code faster, and for it to be able to include more data.

### Purpose 
 The purpose of this challenge was to determine whether refactoring previously written code successfully makes the VBA script run faster and provides the same data analysis result. Once results are produced, data will be analyzed in order to help Steve make his decision, about which stocks would be best for his parents to invest in given the 2017 and 2018 trends.

## Results

What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
