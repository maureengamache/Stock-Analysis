# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project
Client Steve wants to do more research for his parents related to the best stock in which to invest. He was pleased with the analysis done on the provided dataset, however now he wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. Given this new task, we will need to refactor our code to be able to run the the stock analysis code faster, and for it to be able to include more data in the futre when provided with larger datasets.

### Purpose 
 The purpose of this challenge was to determine whether refactoring previously written code successfully makes the VBA script run faster and provides the same data analysis result. Once results are produced, data will be analyzed in order to help Steve make his decision, about which stocks would be best for his parents to invest in given the 2017 and 2018 trends.

## Analysis

### Analysis 2017
When analyzing all stocks in the data set in 2017, it appears all but one stock, "TERP" , provided profitable returns. Amoung the profitable stocks there were four stocks that returned over 100%. Those stocks were "DQ", "ENPH", "FSLR" and "SEDG", with the highest performing stock being "DQ", see *Figure 1* below. Now, in our previous anlysis of year over year, comparing 2017 to 2018, it was noted that the "DQ" stock did not perform as well in 2018, and in fact had a significant decrease in return, see *Figure 2* below in Analysis 2018.

### Analysis 2018
 When analyzing all stocks in the data set in 2018, it appears all but two stocks, "ENPH" and "RUN" , provided non-profitable returns. Amoung the non-profitable stocks it is important to note that three out of the four profitable stocks in 2017 were no longer profitable in 2018, including "DQ", "FSLR" and "SEDG". It is also important to note that  in 2017, "RUN" was not profitable, however in 2018 it provided an 84% return. The only consistently profitable stock across both years is "ENPH", see *Figure 1* above and *Figure 2* below.

## Results

What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
